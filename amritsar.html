        <p>Amritsar, a city steeped in history and spirituality, is home to some of the most iconic landmarks in India. Here are some must-visit places in this vibrant city:</p>

        <p>Visit the holiest shrine of Sikhism, the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib). The shimmering gold facade is reflected in the sacred Amrit Sarovar, creating a serene atmosphere. Partake in the Langar (community kitchen) and experience the warmth of Sikh hospitality.</p>

        <h2>Jallianwala Bagh</h2>
        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2024-02-13 at 15.10.36_3bb82f0f.jpg" alt="Jallianwala Bagh">

        <p>Reflect on the poignant history of Jallianwala Bagh, the site of the infamous massacre in 1919. The memorial garden stands as a reminder of the sacrifices made during the struggle for independence, with bullet marks still visible on the walls.</p>

        <h2>Wagah Border</h2>
        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2024-02-13 at 15.10.36_49674ad6.jpg" alt="Wagah Border">

        <p>Experience the patriotic fervor at Wagah Border, where the Beating Retreat ceremony takes place daily. The synchronized lowering of the flags by the Indian and Pakistani border guards is a captivating display of national pride.</p>

        <p>Plan your visit to Amritsar to soak in the spirituality, history, and cultural richness that defines this vibrant city.</p>
